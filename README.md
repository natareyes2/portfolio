<h1> Portfolio </h1>


<h2> Challenges </h2>
I had to go through many challenges, trial and error, it is a bit difficult for me with media queries, and the different image resolutions, I try to be very organized, using divs, but I have to be more aware of the divs I added to know what is the That could cause problems for me later, I wasn't perfect, but I was able to do things with the knowledge I acquired this semester, I hope to continue improving and have better results.
